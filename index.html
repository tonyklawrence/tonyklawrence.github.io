      <div class="content">
        My love of functional programming has been getting stronger over the past year so I decided to attend Well-Typed Haskell courses at Skills Matters1. As I&rsquo;m a huge fan of JetBrains IntelliJ IDE I found using Haskell a little lacking in this area (unless you can be online with FP Complete.)
In this article I will explain how I configured my Haskell development environment using Sublime Text 3 and a few extras.

$ ruby -e &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)&quot;  You will be required to enter your administrator password and might be asked to install Apples Xcode developer tools and also Git versioning tool.

      <div class="content">
        I&rsquo;ve had my ReadyNAS drop of the network a couple of times, and lately has been warning me about errors on my disk 2 so I thought it was a good idea to replace that drive. Due to the few network issues I&rsquo;ve had I decided that taking the opportunity to restore the ReadyNAS was a good idea (I had messed with it quite a bit before.)
As I have just under 3TB used my new replacement drive would be 3TB so that I could use it for backup / restore and then as a replacement to the failing 2TB drive.

      <div class="content">
        Recently I came across some code that was iterating over collections in order to group them by certain fields. This code was repeated a few times as it was grouping more than once. To me this seemed very verbose and a little hard to understand. As Guava was the available library and one that does not include any grouping I decided to have a go myself.
The iterative approach Map&lt;Character, List&lt;String&gt;&gt; group = newHashMap(); List&lt;String&gt; strings = asList(&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;, &quot;four&quot;); for (String string : strings) { Character firstCharacter = string.

      <div class="content">
        Yesterday my MacBook Air decided that it no longer trusted my Time Machine backup and wanted to create a new one. Apart from the time this would take (20gb over WiFi) and the fact that I&rsquo;d lose my current history I was a little bit wary so declined. Unfortunately this was not a the last I heard of it. Time Machine refused to back up until I started a new back up.

        I&rsquo;ve recently been using IA Writer as my markdown editor. I love the fact that I can use any of my iDevices and that it&rsquo;s all synced in the iCloud. But how do I access the iCloud data so that I can include it in my Octopress git repository?
Show me the data On Mountain Lion (and Lion I believe) all the iCloud data is hidden away in your home directory.

      <div class="content">
        When upgrading to Mountain Lion I decided to replace my existing Wordpress site with a static one. There were many reasons for this. With Wordpress I was unable to easily version control my posts into GitHub. I also had no control over and backup strategies. One of my colleagues - Toby Weston - was running Octopress so I thought I&rsquo;d take a look.
Octopress is based upon Jekyll, developed and used by GitHub.

        It&rsquo;s been far too long since I&rsquo;ve written anything on this site. I&rsquo;ve got plenty of topics, it&rsquo;s just finding the time to write something down. This one comes from a comment on one of my previous posts about Guava and Modern Java.
Guava has recently been upgraded to version 12 and along with this release comes the idea of a Fluent Interface as described by Martin Fowler and Eric Evans.

      <div class="content">
        I often hear people complain about Java (I’m not excluding myself from this) about how restrictive the language can be compared to others. We all know how noisy it is when working with functional libraries. Wouldn’t it be great if we had a lambda style syntax in Java?
This is where Enumerable for Java comes in. This has been developed by Håkan Råberg who describes the library as:
 &ldquo;Ruby/Smalltalk style internal iterators for Java 5 using bytecode transformation to capture expressions as closures.

      <h1 class="title"><a href="http://tonylawrence.com/post/java/the-totally-lazy-way/">Modern Java - The Totally Lazy Way</a></h1>
      <div class="content">
        A few weeks ago I blogged about Modern Java using Googles Guava to write functional programs. One of the comments on that blog was by a good friend on mine Franck Rasolo. He suggested I took a look at Totally Lazy by Daniel Bodart as an alternative to Guava. So I decided to implement the same functional calculator I wrote in the previous post using totally lazy instead and here are my findings.

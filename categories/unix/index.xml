      <title>Running Pi-Hole inside Docker on Synology</title>

      <description>When I first wrote about installing Pi-Hole inside Docker on my Synology NAS I came up with a solution that required a little modification to the standard DSM (see: Freeing up port 80 on Synology DSM). Whilst this worked I was never completely happy with this approach as I never want to modify system files as you can never be sure.
After a little work and a few updates to the Pi-Hole docker image I feel this is now possible without modification.</description>

      <description>I recently purchased a new NAS for my home network. My reliable ReadyNAS has been working flawlessly for the past 6 years and still going strong (if a little slow). As I really wanted a NAS that would support docker containers I was drawn to the DS916+.
So far everything has been easy to configure, launching docker containers a breeze and has generally been a great experience; apart from 1 little thing.</description>

      <title>Backing up and restoring a ReadyNAS Ultra</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had my ReadyNAS drop of the network a couple of times, and lately has been warning me about errors on my disk 2 so I thought it was a good idea to replace that drive. Due to the few network issues I&amp;rsquo;ve had I decided that taking the opportunity to restore the ReadyNAS was a good idea (I had messed with it quite a bit before.)
As I have just under 3TB used my new replacement drive would be 3TB so that I could use it for backup / restore and then as a replacement to the failing 2TB drive.</description>

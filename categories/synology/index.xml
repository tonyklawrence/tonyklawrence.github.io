      <description>Update This post was updated in January 2018 and details how to get the Debian version of pihole-docker running as the Alpine version is no longer supported.
 When I first wrote about installing Pi-Hole inside Docker on my Synology NAS I came up with a solution that required a little modification to the standard DSM (see: Freeing up port 80 on Synology DSM). Whilst this worked I was never completely happy with this approach as I never want to modify system files as you can never be sure.</description>

      <description>I recently purchased a new NAS for my home network. My reliable ReadyNAS has been working flawlessly for the past 6 years and still going strong (if a little slow). As I really wanted a NAS that would support docker containers I was drawn to the DS916+.
So far everything has been easy to configure, launching docker containers a breeze and has generally been a great experience; apart from 1 little thing.</description>
